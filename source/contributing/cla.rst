Contributor License Agreement
=============================

All external contributions to NGINX require that a Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) has been signed be the contributor. In addition a Corporate CLA will need to be signed by an appropriate signing authority if the contributor is acting on behalf of a company or organisation.

Individual CLA
--------------

Whether you are an individual or someone acting on behalf of a company or organisation you need to sign the Individual CLA before we can accept contributions from you.

The document should be completed and emailed to cla@nginx.com.

The Individual CLA is available in Open Document format :download:`here <NGINX - Contributor License Agreement Individual 20151109.odt>` or PDF format :download:`here <NGINX - Contributor License Agreement Individual 20151109.pdf>`.

Corporate CLA
-------------

If you are contributing on behalf of a company or organisation you will need to get someone with signing authority to fill in the Corporate CLA for your company/organisation.

The Schedule A section of the Corporate CLA will need to be updated and sent to us with all current staff allowed to contribute whenever you need to add or remove a member of staff.

As with the Individual CLA the document should be completed and emailed to cla@nginx.com.

The Corporate CLA is available in Open Document format :download:`here <NGINX - Contributor License Agreement Corporate 20151109.odt>` or PDF format :download:`here <NGINX - Contributor License Agreement Corporate 20151109.pdf>`.
